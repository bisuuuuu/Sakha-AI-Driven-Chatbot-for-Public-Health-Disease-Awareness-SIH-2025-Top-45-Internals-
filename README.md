# Sakha-AI-Driven-Chatbot-for-Public-Health-Disease-Awareness-SIH-2025-Top-45-Internals-
 Created a multilingual AI chatbot to educate rural and semi-urban populations about preventive healthcare, disease symptoms, and vaccination schedules. The chatbot should integrate with government health databases and provide real-time alerts for outbreaks and manymore.
So basically our aim is to meet goals of Sustainability development goals-3 of United Nations that to minimize the gap realted to health in rural and semi-urban areas so that all will be acquinted with it.I created this using various techs  and also planned a better architecture for it as the topic is from Odisha government so we focused that how rural people in odisha can really take advantage of it .We also used whatsapp chatbot which we deployed using twilio and there are mora than 10+ usuable features in it starting from diseases outbreak to vacination alerts directly to a persons smartphone to remind him all the important things or any appointments .Also image analyzer is there which give 90% accuracy by analyzing image,Presently only working for wound , We have used multiple apis like gemini api and open ai apis ,If we get funded by any Government then we will surely built our own model .
